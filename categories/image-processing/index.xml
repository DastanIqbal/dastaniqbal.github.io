The process involves three key steps: Enrollment, Testing, and Inference.
Enrollment
I﻿n enrollment we take training dataset of images of the individual and pass through the neural network to obtain 128-dimension feature descriptor of each image.
T﻿esting
I﻿n testing we take test image of the each individual and evaluate the system accuracy. To test the accuracy we calculate distance between test and enrolled feature descriptor if distance is less than the threshold value.</description></item><item><title>Virtual Makeup: Eyeliner Effect using OpenCV and Dlib</title><link>https://dastaniqbal.github.io/blog/2025-01-08-virtual-makeup-eyeliner-effect-using-opencv-and-dlib/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2025 18:47:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dastaniqbal.github.io/blog/2025-01-08-virtual-makeup-eyeliner-effect-using-opencv-and-dlib/</guid><description>In this post we will walk through the solution to apply eyeliner

We are using dlib to detect the face and extract facial landmark. We will use OpenCV capabilities to do image processing.
These are the steps needed
Image with face Detect face on the image Find lips landmark using dlib. Create a mask for the lips Apply alpha blending mask and original image For eg: I = aF + (1-a)B Display image with applied lipstick Step 1.</description></item></channel></rss>
